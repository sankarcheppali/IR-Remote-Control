necpoj == 2 	  we just detected the second edge of the input signal and we finished the 9ms leding pulse and now 4.5ms space started 
				  after the second edge the next pulse is expected to arrive around 4.5ms so TIMEOUT is set to 5.5ms and PREPULSE is 3ms
		

necpoj == 3  	  we just detected the third edge of the input singal and we finished 4.5ms space and addres lsb is now started 
				  after the third edge the next pulse is expected to arrive around 562.5us so TIMEOUT is set to 2.3ms and PREPULSE is 0.2ms (timeout can be much less at this state but to do this i have to add one more if else statemetnt)
		
necpoj == 4 	  we just decected the forth edge and the 562.5 us burt of LSB of address has ended now a little space for '0'562.5us  or for '1' 1.6875ms   
				  after the forth edge the next pulse is expected to arrive for '0' around 562.5us  and for '1' 1.675ms so TIMEOUT is set to 2.3ms and PREPULSE is 0.2ms
		
necpoj ==5 to 66  data pulse keep comming  
					TIMOUT and PREPLUSE remain same as above.		   
			
necpoj ==67		  we just fined the command inverse MSB space not the final 562.5us burst has stated  so we fined the receiveing
